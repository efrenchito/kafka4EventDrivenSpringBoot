📝 What is a Monolithic application?
A monolithic application is indeed built as a single unit, 
and because of this, any change typically necessitates redeploying the entire application. 
This design can make scaling and updating more challenging compared to Microservices. 

📝 what is a Microservice application?
A Microservice is indeed all about being smaller, focused on a single functionality, and autonomous. 
This independence allows for easier deployment, testing, and scalability compared to traditional architectures. 

📝 Main differences between a Microservice and a Monolithic application?
In terms of deployment, fault isolation, scalability and Flexibility.
Microservices' independence and smaller scope make troubleshooting and deploying updates much simpler and faster. 
It also means any issues can be restricted to their specific service rather than causing a chain reaction in the whole system, 
which is a huge advantage over monolithic applications. 

📝 How Microservices communicate with each other?
The most common way of communication between Microservices is via HTTP Request.
()"Microservice-A" sends an HTTP Request to "Microservice-B".)
However notice that HTTP Request is not the only way of communication between Microservices
For those cases when you need to communicate multiple Microservices about certain situation
✅ Here it's when Event Driven communication and Apache Kafka can help

📝 What is a synchronous & asynchronous communication between Microservices?
Synchronous communication definitely involves waiting for an immediate response before continuing, 
while asynchronous communication allows processes to keep running and deal with the response later when it's ready. 
This flexibility of asynchronous communication can make systems more scalable and resilient, especially under heavy workloads.

🚀 Apache Kafka 101
===============================================================================================================================
📝 What is Apache Kafka?
Apache Kafka is primarily used as a Distributed Event Streaming Platform.
It excels in collecting, processing, storing and integrating large volumes of data in real-time.
Kafka allows different systems and applications to publish (produce) and subscribe to (consume) streams of events, 
making it highly suitable for event-driven architectures

📝 Tools/Platforms like Kafka...
 ActiveMQ | RabbitMQ
 [AWS] SQS | SNS | Kinesis Stream
  -> Difference between SQS & SNS?

📝 What are the main Apache Kafka Components?
Cluster | Controller | Broker | Topic | Partitions | Replicas | Client (Producer/Consumer)

🚀 How to create a Kafka Producer (Spring Boot)
===============================================================================================================================

📝#1 Create Spring Boot Project
---------------
⚓ https://start.spring.io
Add dependency  ´Spring for Apache Kafka [MESSAGING]´



📝#2 Create Topic
---------------
org.springframework.kafka.config.TopicBuilder -> Spring utility class to create Kafka Topics
org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.NewTopic;      -> TopicBuilder returns a NewTopic (org.apache.kafka)
...
✏️ >>>>>
    @Bean
    NewTopic createTopic() {
        return TopicBuilder
            .name("product-created-events-topic")
            .partitions(3).replicas(3)
            .configs(Map.of("min.insync.replicas", "2"))
            .build();
    }
~
🧐🕵️‍♂️🔎 To check if Topic was created successfully
[IntelliJ] ProductsMicroservice >  ▶️ ProductsMicroserviceApplication 
[terminal]
$ cd {WORKSPACE}/kafka
$ ./bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --topic product-created-events-topic

...

🤯⚠️🧨 Creating the topic beforehand is a best practice
 -> To avoid runtime errors
 -> Ensure correct topic configurations
🧐🕵️‍♂️🔎 Auto-creation is usually disabled in production environments:
  ✏️>>> auto.create.topics.enable=false

🧐🕵️‍♂️🔎 @Bean TopicBuilder...build() is idempotent -> It won't override / nor cause errors if Topic already exists



📝#3 Publish events in Kafka Topic (KafkaTemplate send Message)
---------------
🧐🕵️🔎 To publish Events in Kafka Topic...
 -> We can use Kafka Template (A Special Client) provided by Spring Framework
 => Kafka Template was designed to send/publish events to Kafka Topic
    ..It's a small wrapper around Kafka Producer
    ..Nicely integrated around Spring Features like Dependency Injection & Automatic Configuration

🧨⚠️🤯 Kafka Messages are key-value pairs and we can specify the data type of this key-value pair via Generic Types at declaration
e.g. KafkaTemplate<String, Event> kafkaTemplate;

🧐🕵️🔎 KafkaTemplate provides a number of send/sendDefault methods that can be used to send Messages to Kafka Topic
 -> Each method has different set of parameters that it accepts
    send(String topic, Integer partition, Long timestamp, K key, V data) : CompletableFuture<SendResult<K,V>>  
    send(String topic, Integer partition, K key, V data) : CompletableFuture<SendResult<K,V>>  
    send(String topic, K key, V data) : CompletableFuture<SendResult<K,V>>  //💥
    send(String topic, V data) : CompletableFuture<SendResult<K,V>>  
    send(org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord<K,V> record) : CompletableFuture<SendResult<K,V>>  
    send(Message<?> message) : CompletableFuture<SendResult<K,V>>  
    sendDefault(Integer partition, Long timestamp, K key, V data) : CompletableFuture<SendResult<K,V>>  
    sendDefault(Integer partition, K key, V data) : CompletableFuture<SendResult<K,V>>  
    sendDefault(K key, V data) : CompletableFuture<SendResult<K,V>>  
    sendDefault(V data) : CompletableFuture<SendResult<K,V>>

✏️ >>>>>
SendResult<String, ProductCreatedEvent> result =
          kafkaTemplate.send("product-created-events-topic", productId, productCreatedEvent).get();

🧐🕵️🔎 From SendResult  .getRecordMetadata() method we can extract -> [partition | topic | offset | timestamp]
 -> Very useful for Debugging & Monitoring purposes
  o Offset track position of record in Topic Partition
  o timestamp to measure latency or throughput of the producer 
...


🧐🕵️🔎 In Kafka we can send Messages synchronously/asynchronously
Notice send/sendDefault methods return a CompletableFuture, so by default they are asynchronous operation
📝>>> CompletableFuture is a Java Concurrency API class, which represents a future result of an Asynchronous Computation
 -> It's used to perform operation asynchronously and then return result of that operation when it's completed
 => To handle this operation result we can use  '.whenComplete(..)' method
 => .whenComplete(..) method it's used to handle operation result whether  it's successful or not 
    ..In case there were a failure in the Asynchronous Operation exception object won't be null
 ✏️ future.whenComplete((result, exception) -> { ... });

🧨⚠️🤯 To handle this CompletableFuture result, we must check if exception object is NULL or not
✏️>>> future.whenComplete((result, exception) -> { 
  if(exception != null) { exception.getMessage(); }
  if(exception == null) { result.getRecordMetadata(); }
});
 -> Notice we use ´exception.getMessage();´ to retrieve the exception details
 -> ´result.getRecordMetadata();´ is used to retrieve metadata associated with successfully sent message to Kafka Topic
    ..Which Topic this message was persisted to ?
    ..Which partition was used ?
    ..What is the offset ?


🧨⚠️🤯 If we'd like to block the current Thread, we have to call the  .join() | .get() method
 -> .join() method will block the current Thread until the future is complete, then it'll return the result of computation once it's available
 -> .get() method directly will return a SendResult<K,V>
 => This way our Kafka publishing operation becomes Synchronous

🧨⚠️🤯 Acknowledgement, Retries & Idempotency are closely related
Let's see how to configure and take advantage of it 👇👇👇
. . .
. .
. 

🚀 How to manage Acknowledgement & Retries❓
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
📝 Acknowledgement confituration properties
---------------
  -> spring.kafka.producer.acks={all|1|0}  #default
  -> min.insync.replicas
  -> replica.lag.time.max.ms


📝 Retries confituration properties
---------------
 -> spring.kafka.producer.retries
 -> spring.kafka.producer.properties.retry.backoff.ms=1000
...
🕵️ delivery.timeout.ms >= linger.ms + request.timeout.ms
spring.kafka.producer.properties.delivery.timeout.ms=120000
spring.kafka.producer.properties.linger.ms=0
spring.kafka.producer.properties.request.timeout.ms=30000

🧐🕵️🔎 Prefer delivery.timeout.ms with linger.ms and request.timeout.ms Instead of retries and retry.backoff.ms
✅1. Simpler and More Accurate Timeout Management
✅2. Avoid Inconsistencies
✅  3. Cleaner and More Predictable Behavior
===============================================================================================================================

📢 Acknowledgement >>>>>
📝#1 Default behavior
---------------
🧐🕵️🔎 By default Kafka Producer is configured to receive this acknowledgment from Leader broker only
 -> So, once the Leader Broker stores the message successfully, it sends acknowledgment to Kafka Producer
 => This configuration allow us to confirm that the message was received and stored

🧨⚠️🤯 For those escenarios where is critical to ensure our Messages don't get lost
✅ We can configure your Kafka producer to wait acknowledgment from all In-Sync replicas.
🔎 If data scenario is NOT critical you can configure Kafka Producer NOT to wait for any acknowledgment at all

[✏️#~/...application.properties]
spring.kafka.producer.acks=all
spring.kafka.producer.acks=1   #default
spring.kafka.producer.acks=0

🧨⚠️🤯 Notice that Kafka Producer will wait for acknowledgment not just from any broker, but only from in-Sync Replicas.
 -> min.insync.replicas: Minimum number of ISR members that must acknowledge a write for it to be considered committed.
 -> replica.lag.time.max.ms: Max time a follower can be behind before being removed from ISR.


📝#2 In-Sync replicas
---------------
min.insync.replicas
replica.lag.time.max.ms
 -> min.insync.replicas: Minimum number of ISR members that must acknowledge a write for it to be considered committed.
 -> replica.lag.time.max.ms: Max time a follower can be behind before being removed from ISR.
...
> What is the difference between Replicas and In-Sync Replicas (ISR)❓
A REPLICA is a copy of a Kafka partition. It can be either a Leader or Follower.
 -> Includes all brokers that have a copy of the partition’s data — regardless of whether they are up-to-date or not.
..
IN-SYNC REPLICAS is the subset of replicas that are fully caught up with the leader.



📢 Retries >>>>>
🧐🔎🕵️ Retry attempts are made at regular intervals which are controlled by property `retry.backoff.ms`
 -> In this case Kafka Producer will retry ten times with one second per interval
✏️ spring.kafka.producer.retries=10
✏️ spring.kafka.producer.properties.retry.backoff.ms=1000

#spring.kafka.producer.retries=10   #default => 2147483647           🔍
#spring.kafka.producer.properties.retry.backoff.ms=1000  #(1 Second) 🔍
spring.kafka.producer.properties.delivery.timeout.ms=120000          ✅
spring.kafka.producer.properties.linger.ms=0                         ✅
spring.kafka.producer.properties.request.timeout.ms=30000            ✅

🤯⚠️🧨 A higher value of linger property, it can help your producer reduce the number of requests that
it sends to the broker and increase the size of each request.
And this can improve the throughput of the producer.

🚀 How to manage Producer Idempotency❓
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
===============================================================================================================================
🧨⚠️🤯 For Idempotence to work, we need to set below  ´spring.kafka.producer.properties´ ...
 -> enable.idempotence=true
 -> acks=all
 -> retries must be greater than zero
 -> max.in.flight.requests must be <= 5
 => If those values are conflicting then you might get a ConfigException ⚠️❌
...
🧐🕵️‍♂️🔎 We could prefer  ´delivery.timeout.ms´  over  ´retries´ & ´retry.backoff.ms´
delivery.timeout.ms has to be greater or equal to linger.ms + request.timeout.ms
